This post will list all my thesis artefacts which are available online.
Three artefacts are stored in Git repositories, namely:

- the [thesis](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/thesis) itself,
- the benchmarking tool ["bench"](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/bench), and
- the natural language understanding [datasets](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/nlu_datasets).

Furthermore, a blogpost is available at [Spindle](https://wearespindle.com/articles/how-to-choose-the-best-natural-language-understanding-system/), and the image below is taken from a [presentation](https://youtu.be/beNztC6mtXw) at the PyGrunn conference.
